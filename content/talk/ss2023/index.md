title: "Data Analysis Workshop"
subtitle: "WÃ¤hlen und politische Einstellungen"
excerpt: "In this workshop, students learn how to independently apply statistical methods to study voter behaviour and political attitudes. In doing so, we critically engage with current research literature. Based on the principles of open and comprehensible science, students learn to understand, interpret, question and test the statistical analyses of this literature through their own replications. Application of statistical methods is taught using Stata (but R material will be provided). Teaching language is German."
