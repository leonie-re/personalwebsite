In this seminar, we will delve into how our sense of self shapes our political beliefs and actions, and how identity plays a crucial role in shaping societies. Since the late 1960s, political science has recognized the profound influence of identities on politics, making it an essential subject for both political and social scientists to study. We will explore this complex relationship by covering classical theoretical literature from socio-psychology and political science on identity and politics. Firstly, we will establish a shared foundation for our journey through identity politics by examining the concept of (social) identity. We will explore classical and recent literature to understand the relationship between identity and politics using interactive discussions and thought-provoking exercise to apply them on contemporary political issues. We are aiming to not only learn about the current state of identity research, but also to improve your academic skills through academic writing exercises during the semester. Active participation in class exercises, as well as assignments, is thus recommended for a successful learning experience.
