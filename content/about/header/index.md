Thank you for visiting my website.
<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I'm a PhD student, lecturer & researcher at the University of Mannheim and MZES (Mannheim Centre for European Social Research). Previously, I was working as a research assistant at the Collaborative Research Center 884 - “Political Economy of Reforms”. My research interest focus mostly on political attitudes and behaviour, democratic representation and inequality, social identity and politics, as well as climate policy.
