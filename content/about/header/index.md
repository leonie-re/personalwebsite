<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I'm a PhD candidate, lecturer & researcher at the University of Mannheim and MZES (Mannheim Centre for European Social Research). I studied at the Johannes Gutenberg-University of Mainz for my B.A. degree and completed my M.A at University of Mannheim. During my studies, I worked as a research assistant at the Collaborative Research Center 884 - “Political Economy of Reforms”. My research interest focus mostly on political attitudes and behaviour, democratic representation and inequality, social identity and politics, as well as climate policy.
