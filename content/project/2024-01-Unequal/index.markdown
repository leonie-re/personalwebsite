## Abstract: 

In today's political sphere, the representation of different groups, especially the voices of young people, has sparked considerable debate. New climate movements, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic, have intensified discussions about the lack of representation of young people's political concerns. Yet, we know little about young people's substantive political interest representation. This study aims to contribute to the growing scholarly work on social group's unequal interest representation by focussing on how well young people's policy preferences are recognized and reflected in policy-making processes. Specifically, it seeks to understand whether policymakers respond differently to the preferences of different age groups, with a particular focus on the concerns of young citizens.  
  
Using a methodology approach inspired by Gilens (2012), this research combines long-term public opinion and policy implementation data from Germany (ResPog). The study assesses whether policymakers exhibit varying levels of responsiveness to the policy preferences of younger demographics compared to older ones. The anticipated outcomes of this study aim to illuminate the complexities of political representation by shedding light on whether policymakers show different levels of responsiveness to the policy preferences of younger compared to older demographic groups, and offering insights into improving the inclusion and representation of young people within democratic systems.
