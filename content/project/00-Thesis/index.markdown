My dissertation is combining questions on political representation and perception of inclusion by social groups and voting behaviour of recent younger generations (in Germany). Recent young generations have a distinct relationship to politics which shows in their political attitudes and behaviour. Young people in general rather participate in unconventional ways, yet after declining electoral turnout among younger generations for decades, Generation Z has shown a renewed interest in participating in the conventional electoral process, marking a notable increase in voting engagement among young people. So why do young people vote again and participate more? I investigate if young people's perception of their representation of the political system they live in explains these changes in voting behaviour. I research the dynamics between their group consciousness, their perceived underrepresentation and their political behaviour. With this project I contribute to the understanding of the perceived political role of young people (in Germany) by diving into their perception of themselves in a political system and how it is transforms into political behaviour.
